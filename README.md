# miniproject-cpp
Mini-project - Includes File Structure concepts (RRN, K-way Merge, Primary Key Indexing) implemented in C++


Hello, reader!
  this is my first project(mini) on GitHub.
- If you're looking to do a mini-project which impelements the above said FS concepts then you've come to the right place.
  The code, however complete, can be further enchanced to greater extents.  
  Those will be done in the future commits and put as diff versions.
- If you're just reading/going through the repo, Happy Reading! :)

Cheers!
Wanderish
